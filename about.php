        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>Climate Change is the single biggest humanity challenge, according to the Millennial project. Almost twenty years ago, Princen  has already pointed out that, “consumption or, more precisely, overconsumption, ranks with population and technology as a major driver of global environmental change.” </p>
        <p>Current carbon emission regimes under the UN-led Paris Agreement put state heads and manufacturers at the center stage, where consumers are very passive. The model’s notorious failure is due to the competitive nature of nation states. This problem only exacerbates under the growing animosity between the US and China, and their alliances. </p>
        <p>States may never be able to strike the hard balance between immediate self-interest (GDP) and long-term common good (that our generations to come can have a bright future).  </p>
        <p>Central to our application, Consuper® aims to provide a solution to this by falling back on the power of people.   </p>
        <p>Beyond and above the famous “invisible hand” analogy for free market economy, Adam Smith also suggested that people have motives besides self-seeking, such as sympathy, passion and adherence to social norms. </p>
        <p>As a disruptive force and game change, Consuper® seeks to empower consumers with carbon emission information of their services and products, so they are free to make responsible buying decisions.</p>
