An initiative to tackle climate change with information technology. The initiative is built on top of a research I conducted on this global issue in my recent masterâ€™s degree study in international relations. Central to this initiative is unleashing consumer power to disrupt and break through the limitations of the current international carbon emission regime, which relies too much on nation states and businesses who have an innate incentive to over-produce and compete with each other on GDP. I have created an e-commerce web application which discloses carbon emission costs throughout each product's entire lifecycle (from manufacturing to recycle and waste management) alongside other key product information and pricing for consumers to make informed buying decisions. The deeper strategic intent of this initiative is to start an industry trend of carbon disclosure and create a long-term domino effect of consumer censorship to pressure and incentivise brands to compete on carbon performance.
